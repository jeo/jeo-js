# Jeo JavaScript Bindings

This project contains JavaScript bindings for the jeo library and a runnable 
tool that executes scripts and provides a REPL.

This project targets exclusively the Nashorn JavaScript engine and requires a
Java 1.8 virtual machine. 

# Building

Building the project requires maven:

    mvn clean install

Once built a runnable executable is located in the `target/app` directory.
